var bio = $('<p>').html('Hello! My name is Sam Rogers and I am an entry-level, full stack developer currently taking classes to learn as many programming languages as I can! So far, I\'m really enjoying JQuery and the ability to execute Javascript code through the use of Node. I was born in New Jersey and received my B.A. in Economics from The George Washington University in Washington, D.C. After graduating from college, I moved to New York City and spent eight years living in various neighborhoods of Manhattan, mostly in the East Village. <br> <br> <br> I started working in the advertising industry and have spent the past 12 years working at various ad agencies with a concentration in digital media, marketing, and communications. In 2017, I moved to Portland, OR in order to change my lifestyle and gain easier access to the thing that I love the most - playing outside! Whether it be hiking, camping, skiing, rock-climbing, mountaineering, or swimming...you name it, I like to do it! Professionally, I currently work at Wieden + Kennedy, an independent ad agency headquartered in Portland, OR. I work on the Old Spice business and am responsible for the planning and execution of their marketing and communications plan. I\'d love to get the opportunity to collaborate on a project, so feel free to contact me with any inquiries! I look forward to the opportunity to work together!');
